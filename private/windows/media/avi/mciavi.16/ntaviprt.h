    /*
     * we need to enter critical sections more than once on a thread
     * (eg when handling a message that requires sending another message
     * to the winproc). This is ok - the same thread can get a critical
     * section more than once. BUT - we need to release it the same number
     * of times.
     *
     * Problems occur in mciaviTaskWait when we release the critsec to yield
     * - we don't know how many times to release it and enter it again.
     *
     * Solution: keep a count of how many times we are in the critsec. When
     * entering, if the count is already > 0, increment it once more, and leave
     * the critsec (ensuring that the count is protected, but the critsec is
     * only one level deep). On leaving, only do a leave if the count reaches
     * 0.
     *
     * NB: Critical sections are now defined per device, in the MCIGRAPHIC
     * struct. This is needed to avoid critsec deadlocks when running multiple
     * 16-bit apps (if a WOW thread yields in any way - and there are a lot
     * of ways - while holding the critical section, and another WOW thread
     * tries to get the critical section, WOW will hang, since it won't
     * reschedule).
