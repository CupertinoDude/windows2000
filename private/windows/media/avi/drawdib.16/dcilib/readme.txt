This directory is the DVA code from VFW 1.1

what this directory builds is a static link library (DVA.LIB) that contains
one API DVAGetSurface.

DVAGetSurface() first checks the DISPLAY driver (via a escape) and if that
fails it has built in support for SVGAs and some other cards built in.

what this builds:

        DVA.LIB         statis link
        DVA.H           header for lib (a DVA client would use this)
        DVADDI.H        defines structures and constants common to
                        DVA clients and DVA providers.

        TEST\DVATST.EXE Test app to make sure all works.
