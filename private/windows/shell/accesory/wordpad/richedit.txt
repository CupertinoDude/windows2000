Richedit2 & MFC

At the time of this writting, MFC (v4.2) has no support for richedit2.  The MFC guys do not know when or how they will be adding support.

To workaround this and get richedit2 support into Wordpad today, I have snapshotted all the MFC richedit1 code and code the it is dependent on that can't be used as-is.  The changes to get this code to use richedit2 instead of richedit1 were minor - change the name of the richedit dll from riched32.dll to riched20.dll and recompile to get Unicode based data structures.

The snapshotted files are:

	afxcmn2.h
	afxcmn2.inl
	afxdlgs2.h
	afxdlgs2.inl
	afximpl2.h
	afxrich2.h
	afxrich2.inl
	dlgcomm.cpp
	dlgfnt.cpp
	oleimpl3.h
	oleinit.cpp
	stdafx2.h
	viewrich.cpp
	winctrl2.cpp
	winctrl4.cpp

These files can be removed one MFC gets native richedit support.  Note that until then the sources files defines _AFX_NO_RICHEDIT_SUPPORT to prevent MFC from using any of it's native richedit support - and maybe conflicting with the wordpad version.

One more change that will probably have to be made after MFC gets up to speed is the name of the base classes that wordpad uses.  I chose to simply add a "2" after the word "RichEdit" in all the native MFC classes - e.g. CRichEdit2View instead of CRichEditView.  If MFC uses a different naming scheme then the code will have to be revised.
