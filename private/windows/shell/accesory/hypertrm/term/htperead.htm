<p><a name="What is HTPE"><font face="Arial"><b>What is
HyperTerminal Private Edition?</b></font></a></p>

<p>HyperTerminal Private Edition (HyperTerminal PE) is a more
powerful version of HyperTerminal, which Microsoft includes with
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0. Hilgraeve developed
HyperTerminal for Microsoft, and began providing HyperTerminal PE
free for personal use shortly after the release of Windows 95.
Each successive release of HyperTerminal PE has won new awards
and caused the program's following to swell. It is today one of
the most popular free downloads on the Internet.</p>

<p>PC Magazine has said &quot;HyperTerminal Private Edition sets
a new standard for what to expect from free software&#133;one of
the Internet's best giveaways.&quot; For excerpts from other
reviews, click <a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html#press">here</a>.
HyperTerminal PE also draws raves from end users. To read some
samples, click <a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html#users">here</a>.</p>

<p>HyperTerminal PE is provided free for personal use and at a
modest charge for business use (see <a
href="#Your Rights and Ours">license agreement</a>). Business
users may evaluate the product for a period of 15 days, then
purchase individual or site licenses if they wish to continue
using it. You can purchase a single-user license for $29.95 by
double-clicking the Purchase Private Edition icon in the folder
that contains HyperTerminal PE, or use the <a

full-featured communications program, HyperACCESS. Businesses or
individuals who need capabilities beyond those of HyperTerminal
PE should consider HyperACCESS.</p>

benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Many additional terminal emulators and file transfer
        protocols</li>

        (Visual Basic Script)</li>
    <li>Redefine keys and add your own buttons to the toolbar

<p>&quot;Thank you for another great product! You have once again
set a Win95 standard we can use to compare all other
&quot;similar but not quite there yet&quot; software.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="What is DropChute+?"><font face="Arial"><strong>What
is DropChute?</strong></font></a></p>

<p>DropChute is a new product from Hilgraeve, entirely separate
from HyperTerminal or HyperACCESS. It's a revolutionary new kind
of software -- personal file delivery software -- the fastest,
easiest, most secure way to exchange files with others over the
Internet, intranets, or modems. It solves the problems people
experience trying to exchange files as email attachments or with
ftp.</p>

<p>DropChute lets you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deliver files of any kind to any other PC through the
        Internet, intranets (TCP/IP networks), or by modem,
        simply by dragging and dropping the files onto that
        person's icon.</li>
    <li>DropChute instantly establishes a REAL-TIME connection to
        the other PC and send files immediately, avoiding the
        time lag and insecurity of e-mail store-and-forward
        mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Send individual files, folders, or entire drives. There
        is no limit to the size, number, or type of files you can
        send.</li>
    <li>Send and receive all data with ironclad error correction,
        crash recovery and on-the-fly compression, so you can be
        sure files come through intact, safe, secure, and fast.</li>
    <li>Exchange files with complete privacy with RSA Public Key
        Authentication and Symmetric Key Encryption, based on
        Microsoft Cryptography APIs. No extra manual steps
        required.</li>
    <li>Enjoy peace of mind that files are free from more than
        6,700 known computer viruses. DropChute detects and
        blocks viruses in incoming files using IBM virus data.</li>
    <li>Chat in real-time with the person at the other end
        before, during or after a file exchange. Attach cover
        notes to files, for the recipient to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>DropChute eliminates problems associated with e-mail
attachments, such as security concerns, clogged mail servers, and
slow or uncertain delivery. It's easier than ftp and more secure.
It exchanges files through a real-time, user-authenticated,
encypted connection, so nobody can intercept and decipher the
data. And it works through firewalls without breaching security.</p>

<p>You can download and install a 30-day FREE trial of DropChute+
simply by rerunning the HyperTerminal PE setup program and
selecting this option. For more information about DropChute+,
click <a href="http://www.dropchute.com">here</a>, or call
800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or e-mail

<p><a name="How HyperTerminal PE is Different"><font face="Arial"><b>How
HyperTerminal PE is Different from HyperTerminal</b></font></a></p>

<p>On the surface, HyperTerminal PE seems identical to
HyperTerminal (except for its banner screen). Both are speedy
32-bit programs that take full advantage of the Windows interface
and features, such as TAPI (Telephony API) and Unimodem universal
modem support. But looks can be deceiving. Each new version of
HyperTerminal PE has added new features not in the versions of
HyperTerminal that Microsoft provides, and has corrected problems
identified after release of HyperTerminal. Sections below list
the new features added in each new version of HyperTerminal PE.</p>

<p><a name="Installing and Using HyperTerminal PE"><font
face="Arial"><b>Installing and Using HyperTerminal PE</b></font></a></p>

<p>HyperTerminal PE 5.0 is provided as a file called HTPE5.EXE.
Simply execute HTPE5.EXE and follow the instructions that
display. You can do this by opening the folder that contains
HTPE5.EXE and double-clicking on this file, or by selecting Run
from the Start menu, browsing to the folder, and selecting this
file. </p>

<p>That's it! HyperTerminal PE is now ready to use. You start and
use it the same as the HyperTerminal program provided with
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0; see your Windows
documentation or Help for instructions.</p>

<p><a name="Using HyperTerminal PE as a Telnet Client"><font
face="Arial"><b>Using HyperTerminal PE as a Telnet Client</b></font></a></p>

<p>Using HyperTerminal PE as a telnet client is simple. You must
have TCP/IP installed on your computer first. Once that is done,
simply change the &quot;Connect using&quot; setting to
&quot;TCP/IP (Winsock)&quot; in HyperTerminal PE's Connect To
property sheet, and enter the Host address (either the host name
or its numeric IP address and port number). Telnet sites are
typically listed in one of the two following forms: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Host name:port number </b>or <b>numeric IP address:port
    number</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you enter no port number, HyperTerminal PE assumes you mean
port number 23, which is the default port for telnet. If the
telnet site you want to reach uses a port other than 23, you will
need to enter the port number.</p>

<p><a name="Changing the Redial Delay"><font face="Arial"><b>Changing
the Redial Delay</b></font></a></p>

<p>You may need to change the redial delay if your country
restricts how quickly busy numbers may be redialed. (The US has
no restrictions.) The default delay is two seconds. To change the
delay, you must change a setting in the Windows registry: </p>

<p>1. Run the Registry Editor. If you don't have a shortcut set
up for the Registry Editor, type REGEDIT at a DOS prompt.<br>
2. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder by clicking on the plus
sign to the left of the folder, or double-click on the folder.<br>
3. Open the SOFTWARE folder and the Microsoft folder that it
contains in a similar fashion.<br>
4. Open the HyperTerminal folder contained in the Microsoft
folder.<br>
5. Open the TimeToRedial folder contained in the HyperTerminal
folder, and a value will appear in the window on the right.<br>
6. Double-click on the (Default) to bring up the Edit String
dialog. Enter the new value and click OK.<br>
7. Exit the Registry Editor.</p>

<p><a name="Use of Special Characters"><font face="Arial"><b>Using
Special Characters</b></font></a></p>

<p>If you find that special characters aren't being sent or
displayed correctly by HyperTerminal PE, try changing to a
different font. Due to the way Windows maps characters under
different fonts, you will see a different character displayed if
you are using the Terminal font, as opposed to the other
available fonts. There is a more complete discussion of font
issues in the <a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpefaq.html">FAQs
about HyperTerminal PE</a> on our web site.</p>
