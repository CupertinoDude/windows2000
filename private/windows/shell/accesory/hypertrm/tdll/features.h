 * This feature is used in the FAR EAST version.  It provides code to
 * support an optional character translation DLL.  This DLL is called to
 * translate the data stream on both input and output.  It does not
 * translate the underlying character values (at the present time), only
 * the encoding method.  The initial version of this will only translate
 * between JIS and Shift-JIS.  For commercial release, additional operations
 * such as JIS escape recovery, UNICODE, and EUC encoding can be added just
 * by changing the DLL.  In fact, the new DLL can be offered as an upgrade
 * to the lower version of the product.

 * These next feature sets are used to control the character width that we
 * are compiling for.  There are 3 disjoint choices.  Only one can be selected.
 * One MUST be selected.  We will have code in here to cause noise if none or
 * more than one is selected.
 *
 * The 3 choices are:
 *
 *      CHAR_NARROW
 *      This is what we use for the U.S. and European versions.  It means all
 *      characters are a single "byte" and each one takes up 8 bits.
 *
 *      CHAR_WIDE
 *      This is what we will use for the UNICODE version if and when it ever
 *      decides to become an option.  It means that all characters are a single
 *      "byte" and each one takes up 16 (for now) bits.
 *
 *      CHAR_MIXED
 *      This is what we use for the FAR EAST (DBCS) version.  It means that the
 *      characters may take up one or two  "bytes" and each one takes up
 *      8 or 16 bits.
 * #define  CHAR_NARROW
