December 1st, 1995

This functionality has been updated to Win95.
The new code has been split into 2 parts.

The driver code is now found in

%_ntdrive%%_ntroot%\private\windows\media\midimap

The GUI code is now found in

%_ntdriver%%_ntroot%\private\windows\shell\control\mmsys

This code should be removed in a couple of months
but keep it around for now, just to be safe.
