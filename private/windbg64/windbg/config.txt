The OSDebug component configuration info will be stored as a set of name/value strings
in the "current" workspace.  The "current" workspace will contain the key name of
the component's "option" registry area.  Configuration info will be saved immediately
in that option area.

The "load" and "save" phases of TLSetup and EMSetup will be performed on the
strings in the current workspace.
