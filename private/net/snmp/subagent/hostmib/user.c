Spt_GetProcessCount
    This function supports hrSystem table attribute "hrSystemProcesses"
    by returning the number of active processes in the system.  This
    code is derived from PERFDLL code in files "PERFSPRC.C" and
    "PERFPROC.C".

/*
|  IN SUPPORT OF:
|
|       HRSYSTEM.C - "hrSystemProcesses"
|
|  EXPLICIT INPUTS:
|
|       None.
|
|  IMPLICIT INPUTS:
|
|       System performance information is fetched thru
|       "NtQuerySystemInformation()".
|
|  OUTPUTS:
|
|     On Success:
|       Function returns the count of active processes as determined by
|       the number of performance information blocks for processes that
|       have both a name and a non-zero thread count (in the style of code in
|       "PERFPROC.C").
|
|     On any Failure:
|       Function returns zero (not a legal number of processes).
|
|  THE BIG PICTURE:
|
|       The generated function "GetHrSystemProcesses()" in HRSYSTEM.C is
|       invoked by the generic subagent to retrieve the current value of 
|       the SNMP attribute "GetHrSystemProcesses".  All the work of 
|       retrieving that value is done by this support function.
|
|  OTHER THINGS TO KNOW:
|
|       This function incurs a rather substantial bit of overhead in that
|       to determine the number of processes active it actually fetches
|       a large slug of performance data (a "slug" per process) for all
|       processes and merely counts the number of slugs returned.
|       This seems to be the only available way to acquire this information.
