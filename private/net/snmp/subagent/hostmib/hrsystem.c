 |  read-write     DateAndTime
 | 
 | "The host's notion of the local date and time of day."
 | 
 | DISCUSSION:
 | 
 | Win32 API function "GetLocalTime" is used to obtain the value returned for a
 | GET on this variable.
 | 
 | Since this variable is "read-write", this implies that the system time can
 | be set by a SET request.  This is done with a Win32 API function
 | "SetLocalTime".
 | 
 | <POA-1> Issuing "SetLocalTime" requires that the issuing process have the
 | "SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME" privilege which is not the default.  Are there any
 | security concerns about issuing the necessary Win32 API function call
 | "AdjustTokenPrivileges" from inside the SNMP agent to enable setting of
 | the system time?  Any other problems?

 | hrSystemInitialLoadDevice
 | 
 |  ACCESS         SYNTAX
 |  read-write     INTEGER (1..2147483647)
 | 
 | "The index of the hrDeviceEntry for the device from which this host is
 | configured to load its initial operating system configuration."
 | 
 | DISCUSSION:
 | 
 | <POA-2> It seems that RFC1514 is attempting to allow the setting and resetting
 | of the default operating system to be booted thru the combination of this
 | attribute and "hrSystemInitialLoadParameters" (below).
 | 
 | While generic PC hardware typically boots from a hard disk partition that is
 | going to wind up being labelled as drive "C:", these two variables speak to a
 | more general situation in which a hardware bootstrap loader can be set to
 | point to almost any system image on a "permanent file system" (to use the unix
 | phrase).  It is apparent that we must attempt to approximate this in some way.
 | 
 | I note that a system file named "Boot.ini" resides on the bootable partition
 | of an Intel NT system.  The one on my system looks like:
 | 
 | >>>>>>>>
 | [boot loader]
 | timeout=30
 | default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT35
 | [operating systems]
 | multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT35="Windows NT Server Version 3.51"
 | multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT35="Windows NT Server Version 3.51 [VGA mode]" /basevideo /sos
 | <<<<<<<<
 | 
 | The contents of this file seems to be the source of the menu that appears
 | during the NT boot process.  Programming a selection from this menu is a close
 | approximation to the flexibility hinted at thru the combination of these
 | two SNMP attributes, "hrSystemInitialLoadDevice" and
 | "hrSystemInitialLoadParameters".
 | 
 | For the purposes of "GET", given the "default" shown in the "Boot.ini" file
 | above, it would seem that the string "multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)"
 | constitutes a passing resemblance to "hrSystemInitialLoadDevice" while the
 | string "\WINNT35" seems to be a good candidate for the value of
 | "hrSystemInitialLoadParameters" (where both of these are drawn from the value
 | specified for "default" under "[boot loader]").
 | 
 | For the purposes of "SET", we would be required to modify this file according
 | to the values received.  I note that the file on my system is write-protected
 | and clearly this poses a problem if we allow the SNMP agent to attempt to
 | modify it.  Additionally, there is the problem of error-checking any value
 | provided from an SNMP SET request (I do not know the exact semantic
 | significance of "multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)" and I do not know how
 | to error-check a received value).
 | 
 | RESOLVED >>>>>>>
 | <POA-2> Call GetWindowsDirectory and work backwards from that (get the 
 | device name, e.g. D, then do a QueryDosDevice to get the underlying 
 | partition information).  Much more accurate than trying to parse boot.ini, 
 | and portable to Alpha.  Leave read-only.
