/*
Host-MIB Cache Overview
-----------------------

This module contains functions that create, maintain and allow for searching
data structures that are used to implement a cache of HOST-MIB information.

Typically, a cache is created on a "per-table" basis and is formed as a
linked-list of CACHEROW structures (all cache structures are defined in
"HMCACHE.H"), one CACHEROW structure for each logical "row" in the table.

The list-head of each cache is a CACHEHEAD structure and is instantiated in
the source module for the functions that service the attributes in that
table (so the CACHEHEAD structure for the cache for the "hrStorage" table is
in module "HRSTOENT.C").

Caches are created at start-up time by special cache-creation functions (coded
to the specs for each table) in each of the "table" source modules.  Those
cache-creation functions (plus the associated "get" and "set" functions) use
the general cache manipulation functions in this module.

For example, a typical cache looks like this:

      HrStorage Table Cache
        "hrStorage_cache"
      (statically allocated
         in "HRSTOENT.C")...

The general cache manipulation functions in this module include:

Name                    Purpose
----                    -------
CreateTableRow          Creates an instance of a CACHEROW with a given
                        attribute count.  (This function does not link the
                        instance into any list, it merely mallocs storage).

AddTableRow             Given an index value, a CACHEROW instance (created by
                        "CreateTableRow()" above) and a CACHEHEAD, this
                        function links the CACHEROW instance into the list
                        described by CACHEHEAD in the proper place given the
                        index value.

         These two functions above are used to populate the cache 
         (typically at startup time).

Name                    Purpose
----                    -------
FindTableRow            Given an index value and a CACHEHEAD, this function
                        returns a pointer to the CACHEROW instance in the
                        CACHEHEAD cache that has the given index.  This 
                        function is used to find a given cache entry (ie table
                        "row") in service for a "get" or "set" routine.

FindNextTableRow        Given an index value and a CACHEHEAD, this function
                        returns a pointer to the CACHEROW instance in the
                        CACHEHEAD cache that IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS the given
                        index.  This function is used to find a given cache
                        entry (ie table "row") in service for "get-next"
                        situations.

GetNextTableRow         Given a CACHEROW row (obtained using either of the
                        routines above), this gets the next entry regardless
                        of index (or NULL if the given row is the last row).
                        (Implemented as a macro in "HMCACHE.H").

RemoveTableRow          Given an index value and a CACHEHEAD, this function
                        unlinks the CACHEROW instance from the cache list
                        described by CACHEHEAD. (TBD in support of PNP)

DestroyTable            Given a pointer to a CACHEHEAD, this function releases
                        every row-instance in the cache (through calls to
                        "DestroyTableRow()" below).  This function presumes
                        that the CACHEHEAD itself is statically allocated.

DestroyTableRow         Given an instance of an (unlinked) CACHEROW, this
                        function releases the storage associated with it.


For Debugging:
Name                    Purpose
----                    -------
PrintCache              Prints a dump on an output file in ASCII of the 
                        contents of a specified cache.  Only works for caches
                        for which a "print-row" function is defined and
                        referenced in the CACHEHEAD structure for the cache.
