 *  Abstract:
 *  
 *    This module contains the code for dealing with the get, set, and
 *    instance name routines for the HrSWInstalled.  Actual instrumentation code is
 *    supplied by the developer.
 *
 *  Functions:
 *
 *    A get and set routine for each attribute in the class.
 *
 *    The routines for instances within the class.
