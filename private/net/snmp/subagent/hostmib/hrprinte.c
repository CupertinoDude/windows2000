 |  ACCESS         SYNTAX
 |  read-only      INTEGER {other(1),unknown(2),idle(3),printing(4),warmup(5)}
 | 
 | "The current status of this printer device.  When in the idle(1), printing(2),
 | or warmup(3) state, the corresponding hrDeviceStatus should be running(2) or
 | warning(3).  When in the unknown state, the corresponding hrDeviceStatus
 | should be unknown(1)."
 | 
 | DISCUSSION:
 | 
 | <POA-14> The actual status and error state of a hardware printer is deeply
 | buried with respect to the application level.  Given that we can acquire
 | the name of the printer driver for a printer, some input on how best to
 | report the hardware status and error state would be appreciated.
 | 
 | LIMITED RESOLUTION >>>>>>>>
 | <POA-14> We report logical printers as though they were hardware printers.
 | This results in certain "undercount" and "overcount" situations when using
 | Host MIB values for inventory purposes.  For status purposes, the status
 | of the logical printers is returned.

 | error conditions are encoded as bits in an octet string, with the following
 | definitions:
 | 
 |     Condition         Bit #    hrDeviceStatus
 | 
 |     lowPaper          0        warning(3)

 |     serviceRequested  7        warning(3)
 | 
 | If multiple conditions are currently detected and the hrDeviceStatus would not
 | otherwise be unknown(1) or testing(4), the hrDeviceStatus shall correspond to
 | the worst state of those indicated, where down(5) is worse than warning(3)
 | which is worse than running(2).
 | 
 | Bits are numbered starting with the most significant bit of the first byte
 | being bit 0, the least significant bit of the first byte being bit 7, the most
 | significant bit of the second byte being bit 8, and so on.  A one bit encodes
 | that the condition was detected, while a zero bit encodes that the condition
 | was not detected.
 | 
 | This object is useful for alerting an operator to specific warning or error
 | conditions that may occur, especially those requiring human intervention."

|
|     On any Failure:
|       Function returns FALSE (indicating "not enough storage" or other
|       internal logic error).
|
|  THE BIG PICTURE:
|
|       At subagent startup time, the cache for each table in the MIB is
|       populated with rows for each row in the table.  This function is
|       invoked by the start-up code in "Gen_HrDevice_Cache()" to
|       populate the cache for the HrDevice table with printer-specific
|       entries.
|
|  OTHER THINGS TO KNOW:
|
|       Since all the attributes in the HrPrinter "sub" table are computed
|       upon request (based on cached information in a selected row in the
|       HrDevice table) there is no need to build a cache specifically for
|       this sub-table.  (This routine is loading the HrDevice cache despite
|       it's name).                                   --------
|
|       This function holds a convention with the GET routines earlier in
|       this module that the "HIDDEN_CTX" attribute for printers contains
|       a string that can be used in OpenPrinter to get a handle to that
|       printer.
