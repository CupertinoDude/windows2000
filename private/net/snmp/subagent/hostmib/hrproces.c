|
|  IMPLICIT INPUTS:

|
|  OUTPUTS:
|
|     On Success:
|       Function returns TRUE indicating that the HrDevice cache has been fully
|       populated with all rows required for Processor devices.
|
|     On any Failure:
|       Function returns FALSE (indicating "not enough storage" or other
|       internal logic error).
|
|  THE BIG PICTURE:
|
|       At subagent startup time, the cache for each table in the MIB is
|       populated with rows for each row in the table.  This function is
|       invoked by the start-up code in "Gen_HrDevice_Cache()" to
|       populate the cache for the HrDevice table with processor-specific
|       entries.
|
|  OTHER THINGS TO KNOW:
|
|       This function is loading entries into the existing HrDevice cache
|       for devices of type "processor" as well as setting up what logically
|       amounts to a "cache" of information used to compute the value of
|       hrProcessorLoad.
|
|       Specifically, this function initializes module-local cells that
|       describe buffers containing processor-time information for each
|       processor.
|
|       This function holds a convention with the GET routines earlier in
|       this module that the "HIDDEN_CTX" attribute for processors contains
|       a number that can be used to select which processor information
|       is to be returned.  We generate this number here.
