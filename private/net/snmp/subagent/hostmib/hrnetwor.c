|
|        for devices created by this cache-population routine.
|
|  IMPLICIT INPUTS:
|
|       None.
|
|  OUTPUTS:
|
|     On Success:
|       Function returns TRUE indicating that the HrDevice cache has been fully
|       populated with all rows required for Network devices.
|
|     On any Failure:
|       Function returns FALSE (indicating "not enough storage" or other
|       internal logic error).
|
|  THE BIG PICTURE:
|
|       At subagent startup time, the cache for each table in the MIB is
|       populated with rows for each row in the table.  This function is
|       invoked by the start-up code in "Gen_HrDevice_Cache()" to
|       populate the cache for the HrDevice table with Network-device 
|       specific entries.
|
|  OTHER THINGS TO KNOW:
|
|       Since all the attributes in the HrNetwork "sub" table are computed
|       upon request (based on cached information in a selected row in the
|       HrDevice table) there is no need to build a cache specifically for
|       this sub-table.  (This routine is only loading the HrDevice cache.
|                                                          --------
|
|       This function holds a convention with the GET routines earlier in
|       this module that the "HIDDEN_CTX" attribute for Network-devices 
|       contains a string that is the value of "hrNetworkIfIndex".
