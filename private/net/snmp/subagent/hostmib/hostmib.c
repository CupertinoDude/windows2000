// General notes:
//
// Microsoft's Extendible Agent for Windows NT is implemented by dynamically
// linking to Extension Agent DLLs that implement portions of the MIB.  These
// Extension Agents are configured in the Windows NT Registration Database.
// When the Extendible Agent Service is started, it queries the registry to
// determine which Extension Agent DLLs have been installed and need to be
// loaded and initialized.  The Extendible Agent invokes various DLL entry
// points (examples follow in this file) to request MIB queries and obtain
// Extension Agent generated traps.


// Necessary includes.

#include <windows.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include <snmp.h>

//
// The file mib.h is a user supplied header file (could be from a code
// generator).  This file should contain the definition, macros, forward
// declarations, etc.  The file mib_xtrn.h contains the external
// declarations for the variable tables and classes composing this MIB.
//

#include "mib.h"
#include "mib_xtrn.h"


// Extension Agent DLLs need access to the elapsed time that the agent has
// been active.  This is implemented by initializing the Extension Agent
// with a time zero reference, and allowing the agent to compute elapsed
// time by subtracting the time zero reference from the current system time.
// This example Extension Agent implements this reference with dwTimeZero.

DWORD dwTimeZero = 0 ;
extern DWORD dwTimeZero ;

/*
 *  SnmpExtensionInit
 *
 *    Extension Agent DLLs provide the following entry point to coordinate the
 *    initializations of the Extension Agent and the Extendible Agent.  The
 *    Extendible Agent provides the Extension Agent with a time zero reference;
 *    and the Extension Agent provides the Extendible Agent with an Event
 *    handle for communicating occurence of traps, and an object identifier
 *    representing the root of the MIB subtree that the Extension Agent
 *    supports.
 *
 *    Traps support is determined by the user in the UserMibInit() routine.
 *    If a valid handle from CreateEvent() is returned in the argument
 *    hPollForTrapEvent, then traps have been implemented and the SNMP
 *    Extendible Agent will poll this Extension Agent to retrieve the traps
 *    upon notification through the SetEvent() routine.  Polling is done
 *    through the SnmpExtensionTrap() routine.  If NULL is returned in the
 *    argument hPollForTrapEvent, there are no traps.

/*
 *  SnmpExtensionTrap
 *
 *    Extension Agent DLLs provide the following entry point to communicate
 *    traps to the Extendible Agent.  The Extendible Agent will query this
 *    entry point when the trap Event (supplied at initialization time) is
 *    asserted, which indicates that zero or more traps may have occured.

 |=========================================================================
 | There are no Traps associated with the HostMIB.  Consequently this
 | routine is taken over and used to refresh the cached information
 | associated with SNMP attribute "hrProcessorLoad" (in "HRPROCES.C") thru
 | a call to function "hrProcessLoad_Refresh()" (also in "HRPROCES.C").
 |
 | This function is being entered because a timer has expired that was
 | initialized by code in "TrapInit()" (in "GENNT.C").  The timer automatically
 | resets itself.
 |
 | All the standard generated code is subsumed by a simple call to
 | "hrProcessLoad_Refresh()".
