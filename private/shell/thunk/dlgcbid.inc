; Callback-type id's for COMMDLG callbacks. All callback-type id's are

; WARNING -- WARNING -- WARNING
;
;   Win32c.dll uses the lower 16 bits of CBID's to index directly into
;   the tables stored in COMDLG.EXE (dlgcb16.asm) and COMDLG32.DLL 
;   (dlgcb32.asm). Those tables *must* match these id's or callbacks 
;   will fail miserably. Do everyone a big favor and add new id's only 
;   at the end, and never change an existing id.
