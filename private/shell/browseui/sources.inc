    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being

# This sources.inc file is shared to build two versions of BROWSEUI.DLL.
# One version is the primary dll, the other is the alternate dll.  Exactly
# what this means depends on which team you're working on.
#
# The IE team needs to do some work under #ifdef IE_BETA2 for some select
# files (listed in the SOURCES= list below).  The shell team needs to
# deliver code to the NT team that does not contain these changes.  Likewise,
# the IE build lab will be building the IE_BETA2 code, while the NT build lab
# will not.
#
# The BUILD_PRODUCT environment variable will determine which version
# is the primary and which version is the alternate DLL.
#
#   "IE"    - browseui\dll builds with the IE_BETA2 code ON
#             browseui\dllalt builds with the IE_BETA2 code off
#
#   "NT"    - browseui\dll builds with the IE_BETA2 code OFF
#             browseui\dllalt builds with the IE_BETA2 code on
#
# We allow for both versions to be built by both teams to catch potential
# build breaks.  Please be diligent and allow both dlls to be built.  Keeping
# the SOURCES= list below short will maintain a quicker build-time.

#        The debug version of browseui links to the Win95 version
#        of shell32.lib simply so we can verify that we load in the
#        browser-only installations on Win95.

# Note:  Do >not< link to ntdll.  Win95 has an extremely minimal

# Note:  Do not link to wininet here.  It is delay-loaded.  If you need
#        a new function from wininet, put it in dllload.c.
