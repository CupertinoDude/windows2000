; This is the Setup information file to install shell components
; Copyright (c) 1999 Microsoft Corporation

;
; This file can be used to copy/delete files, to create/delete start menu shortcuts,
; and to add/remove registry keys.  This file gets processed during GUI mode setup.
; Shortcuts and HKCU registry keys created here will be automagically applied to every
; users profile directory/registry hive.  When making "per user" changes in this file,
; keep the following in mind:
;   1.) You can only delete files that already exist in the "default user" profile
;       from this file.  If the file does not exist in the default user profile then
;       you change will have no effect on the various users profiles.
;   2.) You can only delete registry keys that already exist in the default user
;       registry hive.  As above, change will only be mirrored if the Default Hive is
;       setup correctly.
; If you need to make a change that violates any of the above limitations then you
; will need to alter \nt\private\windows\setup\inf\win4\inf\hiveusd.inx to make the
; change work correctly.  See that file for further details.
;
; Also remember that, as a general practice, you should NEVER write shell policies to
; HKCU.  Write the policy to HKLM and use SHRegGet/Set...Value to check the policy.

; The format of this section is:
;   SectionName = DirID[,SubDir]
; Where section name corresponds to the CopyFiles or DelFiles section name.  You can
; get a list of DirID values from \nt\public\sdk\inc\setupapi.h.  Or you can build
; your own DirID by taking a shell special folder id (look for CSIDL_ in shlobj.w) and
; adding 0x4000 to the value.  You must convert these values to base 10 before using.
