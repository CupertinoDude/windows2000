// (and we can't just move the #undef up above priv.h, it will still
// be ignored because the PCH already exists).

// i'm 99% sure that the reason we don't want DEBUG on here is to avoid
// having any static data in shlwapi.  that's an old restriction (though
// still a perf issue) (but not for DEBUG...), so for DEBUG we can probably
// just remove this entire hack.  i haven't tested that theory yet though
// so for now we'll continue to live w/ it.
