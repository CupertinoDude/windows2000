BUG #1 (Word95): IPersistFile::Load disables open-in-place

    Bug: When you bind to a WordDocument via file moniker, activating it
         as a DocObject will open it in the Word application window. This
         is caused by an internal flag, which is set by IPersistFile::Load.

    Work-around: Call SetHostName() after IPersistFile::Load, which will
         reset this internal flag.

BUG #2 (Word 95): Word does not call IPersistStorage::Save when saving.

    Bug: Word95 does not call IPersistStorage::Save when I insert a new shell
         embedding and select File->Save(). Here is the calling sequence.

        [Excel]      GetData, GetClassID, Save, HandsOffStorage, SaveComplated
        [PowerPoint] Update, GetClassID, Save, SaveComplated
        [WordPad]    GetClassID, Save, SaveComplated
        [Word]       Update, GetData, HandsOffStorage, SetHostNames, SaveComplated

    Work-around: Unknown
