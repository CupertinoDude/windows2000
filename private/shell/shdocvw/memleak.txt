 When you hit an assert when shutting down IE, it means we have some
memory leak. It does not necessarily mean YOU have introduced some
new memory leak. In order to verify, please run following pre-check-in
tests. If it does not hit the same Assert, it means you haven't introduced
any memory leak in the following code path.

Test I:
1. Start Run "{c:\windows\system}\blank.htm"
2. Select File->New Window
3. Close Both

Test II:
1. Start Run "http://ohserv"
2. Click a link to "Development BVT"
3. Click the go back button

there is an erroneous assertion for a CUrlHistory object.  it gets freed
after the assertion on MSHTML process detach.  this will be fixed post IE3 ship
