//  then that infects our thread with the multithreaded virus, and a
//  COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED will fail.
//
//  In this case, we must turn around and re-init ourselves as
//  COINIT_MULTITHREADED to increment the COM refcount on our thread.
//  If we didn't do that, and that other thread decided to do a
//  CoUninitialize, that >secretly< uninitializes COM on our own thread
//  and we fall over and die.
