To save a document with an extension other than the one the program

if you run Notepad and save a file under the name
\par 
\tx360
\tab Dr.Z
\par
it will actually be saved under the name Dr.Z.txt.  But if you type
\par
\tab "Dr.Z"
\par
then the document will be saved under the name Dr.Z.
\par
This is a feature, 
so that you can name a document
\par
\tab Letter to Dr. Johnson
\par
and it will be saved as "Letter to Dr. Johnson.txt" so that the 
document will be properly associated with Notepad.  Otherwise, 
the extension would be "Johnson", which is not a great idea.

double-click on it and mess up your mail.  After creating a 
separate login for your kids and configuring the system to use a 
different desktop for each user, you can delete the Inbox from the 
system-wide desktop, then create the Inbox as a file on your 
private desktop.  When you log in, you get an Inbox on your 
desktop, but your kids don't.\par

	    Direct Cable Connection, and Network Neighborhood}
{\b Consequences of hiding Network Neighborhood}\par
Since shell support for the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) notation 
is handled by the Network Neighborhood, hiding the 
Network Neighborhood icon will prevent Explorer from accessing resources 
via UNCs.  In order to access network resources from Explorer, 
you need to map them to a drive letter.  Note that 
the MS-DOS command prompt and other applications are not affected by this 
setting, because they do not use the Network Neighborhood to resolve UNCs.\par
In particular, hiding the Network Neighborhood prevents Direct Cable 
Connection from displaying the contents of the host computer. 
Aside from this, Direct Cable Connection functions normally.\par

K{\footnote The Microsoft Network}
{\b The Microsoft Network created as a file acts strangely}\par
The Microsoft Network was not designed to be created as a file, 
although it mostly works.\par
The Microsoft Network assumes that 
the only place its icon can possibly exist is on the desktop 
as a special desktop icon.  If you right-click the The Microsoft 
Network icon-as-file, you will see two Delete commands. 
The first Delete command (beneath 
the "Send To" command) removes the The Microsoft Network special desktop 
icon, {\i not} the created-as-file icon you right-clicked. 
The second Delete command (beneath "Create Shortcut") 
is the standard delete command which actually deletes the item 
you clicked on.  Neither actually uninstalls The Microsoft Network; 
to do that, use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel.
\par
{\b Workaround:}  Do not use the first Delete command (beneath 
the "Send To" command).  Only use the second Delete command (beneath 
"Create Shortcut").

When you ask to see its properties, 
Inbox is unable to make its properties coexist with the 
standard properties provided by Explorer, so it creates a
