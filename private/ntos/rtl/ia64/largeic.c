Routine Description:

    This function divides an unsigned large integer by an unsigned long
    and returns the resultant quotient and optionally the remainder.

Arguments:

    Dividend - Supplies the dividend value.

    Divisor - Supplies the divisor value.

    Remainder - Supplies an optional pointer to a variable
        that receives the remainder.

Return Value:

    The large integer result is stored at the address supplied by a0.

Routine Description:

    This function multiplies a signed large integer by a signed integer and
    returns the signed large integer result.

    Multiplier - Supplies the multiplier value.

Return Value:

    The large integer result is returned
