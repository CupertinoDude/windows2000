/*++
Routine Description:

    This function synchronizes the I-fetch pipeline. Typically this routine will be
    executed by every processor in the system in response to an IPI after the cache
    is flushed. Each processor executing RFI while leaving the IPI produces the
    serialization effect that is required after isync to make sure that further
    instruction prefetches wait till the ISYNC completes.

Arguements:

    SignalDone Supplies a pointer to a variable that is cleared when the
    requested operation has been performed.

    Parameter1 - Parameter3 - Not used.

Return Value:

    Nothing.

Routine Description:

    N.B. Although PowerPC maintains cache coherency across processors, we
    use the flash invalidate function (h/w) for I-Cache sweeps which doesn't
    maintain coherency so we still do the MP I-Cache flush in s/w.   plj.

Arguments:

    AllProcessors - Supplies a boolean value that determines which instruction
        caches are flushed.

Return Value:

Routine Description:

    This function is used to drain prefetches,demand references followed by flushing
    the cache followed by draining pending fc cache line evictions to a specified range
    address in all processors in the system.


Arguments:

    AllProcessors -  All processors in the system.

    BaseAddress - Supplies a pointer to the base of the range that is flushed and drained.

    Length - Supplies the length of the range that is flushed and drained for the base
        address is specified.

Return Value:

    None.

    Note:  This is used when changing attributes of WB pages to UC pages.
