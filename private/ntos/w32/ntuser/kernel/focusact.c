*              These flags are defined as follows:
*

*                            mouse click and not set if some other action
*                            caused this window to be activated.  This bit
*                            determines the value of wParam on the
*                            WM_ACTIVATE message.
*
*              ATW_SETFOCUS  This parameter is set if this routine should
*                            set the focus to NULL.  If we are called from
*                            the xsxSetFocus() function this will not be
*                            set indicating that we shouldn't screw with the
*                            focus.  Normally (if we are not called from
*                            xxxSetFocus), we set the focus to NULL here
*                            and either the app or xxxDefWindowProc() sets
*                            the focus to the appropriate window.  If the
*                            bit is not set, we don't want to do anything
*                            with focus.  The app may still do a call to
*                            xxxSetFocus() when the WM_ACTIVATE comes
*                            through, but it will just be redundant on its
*                            part.
*

*                            before determining if we bring the window to
