  Header File:  Dialog.H

  This defines the C++ class used to encapsulate dialogs.  It supports both
  modal and modeless styles.  This class uses a static method for the dialog
  procedure, which automatically caches the "this" pointer for the class in the
  DWL_USER field of the window's internal structure for the dialog.  This
  hand-off is accomplished by setting the lParam parameter on a DialogBoxParam
  or CreateDialogParam call to the "this" pointer.  It also saves the dialog
  handle in a protected member for easy access from derived classes.

  To create a C++ class for any specific dialog, derive the class from this
  class, providing the dialog ID and instance handle needed to get the dialog
  resource in the derived class constructor.  Also provide the parent window
  handle, if there is one.

  The dialog procedure then provides virtual functions for Windows messages
  of interest.  I've added these as needed.  If I were going to a truly
  universal class of this sort, I'd just as well go to MFC, and save the
  debugging time, so this approach seems reasonable to me.

  12-11-96- to support the hook procedure used in the application UI, I've
  added two protected members to allow this support to be in the base class.
  If there is a hook procedure, it gets first chance at all messages except
  WM_INITDIALOG.  If it returns TRUE, we do no further processing, otherwise
  we will call the various overrides, if applicable.

  For WM_INITDIALOG, we call any overrides first.  The derived class' OnInit
  procedure can then supply an LPARAM for the hook procedure (e.g., a pointer
  to some relevant class member), if desired.  We handle the returns from the
  calls so that if either an override or the hook procedure states it has
  altered the focus, we return the appropriate value.  This is pretty standard
  handling for dialog hooks, so it should serve well, and it's almost 0 code.
