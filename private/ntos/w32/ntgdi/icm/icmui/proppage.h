  Header File:  Property Page.H

  This defines the C++ class used to encapsulate property pages.  This class
  has a static method for the dialog procedure, which automatically caches the
  "this" pointer for the class in the DWL_USER field of the windows internal
  structure for the dialog used for the property page.  This hand-off is
  accomplished by setting the lParam field of the PROPSHEETPAGE structure to
  the "this" pointer.  It also saves the dialog handle in a protected member
  for easy access from derived classes.

  To create a C++ class for any specific property sheet, derive the class
  from this class, providing the dialog ID and instance handle needed to get
  the resource in the m_psp member.

  The dialog procedure then provides virtual functions for Windows messages
  of interest.  I've added these as needed.  If I were going to a truly 
  universal class of this sort, I'd just as well go to MFC, and save the 
  debugging time, so this approach seems reasonable to me.

  Shell Extension property page class

  Noteworthy details:

  These pages are displayed by the shell.  The thread of execution is such that
  we create the page, then return to the shell.  The shell will then attempt to
  unload the extension.  It will query CanDllUnloadNow to do this.  Since
  freeing the library frees the page template and dialog procedure, we can't
  allow this to happen while any instances of this class exist.

  However, the shell doesn't know this is a class, so it won't destroy it.

  What I've done is build a circular chain of all of the instances of this
  class, anchored in a private static class member.  A public static method
  (OKToClose) then walks the chain.  If an instance's window handle is no
  longer valid, then the shell has finished with it, and we delete it.  The
  criterion for closing then becomes not finding a valid handle (so we don't
  delay unloading by any lazy evaluation, such as requiring an empty chain
  on entry).

  All Property pages displayed by a property sheet extension should be derived
  from this class.

  While a mechanism is provided by property sheets for a reference count
  maintenance mechanism, this mechanism will not call any class destructor-
  this could lead to memory leaks, which is why I've chosen this method.
