/*++

Routine Description:

    ALPHA implementation specific:

    This routine returns the physical address for a virtual address
    which is valid (mapped) for write access.

    If the address is valid and writable and not within KSEG0
    the physical address within KSEG0 is returned.  If the address
    is within KSEG0 then the called address is returned.

    NOTE: The physical address must only be used while the interrupt
    level on ALL processors is above DISPATCH_LEVEL, otherwise the
    binding between the virtual address and the physical address can
    change due to paging.

Arguments:

    VirtualAddress - Supplies the virtual address to check.

    Opaque - Supplies a pointer to fill with an opaque value.

Return Value:

    Returns NULL if the address is not valid or readable, otherwise
    returns the physical address of the corresponding virtual address.

Environment:

    Kernel mode IRQL at DISPATCH_LEVEL or greater.

MmDbgTranslatePhysicalAddress64 (

/*++

Routine Description:

    ALPHA implementation specific:

    The Alpha processor provides a direct-mapped address space called
    the superpage.  The entire physical address space can be
    addressed via the superpage.  This routine translates a physical
    address to its corresponding superpage address.  Unfortunately,
    the base superpage address is processor-dependent.  Therefore, we
    have to compute it based on the processor level.  As new processors are
    released, this routine will need to be updated.

    This routine does not use PTEs.

Arguments:

    PhysicalAddress - Supplies the physical address to translate.

Return Value:

    The virtual (superpage) address which corresponds to the physical address.

Environment:

    Kernel mode IRQL at DISPATCH_LEVEL or greater.
