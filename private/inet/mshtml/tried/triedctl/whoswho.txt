Ambients.cpp    Implements the ambient property UserMode.

DEInsTab.cpp    Implements DEInsertTableParam, a COM object which is passed to ExecCommand
                to create a table.

DENames.cpp     Implements DEGetBlockFmtNamesParam, which returns a SAFEARRAY of format
                names for populating style menus.

DHSHWUI.cpp     Implements a very bland IDocHostShowUI interface.

DHTMLEd.cpp     Basic DLL functions.  DllRegisterServer removes some older GUIDs as well.
                DllUnregisterServer deals with ATL bugs for logo compliance.

DHTMLEd.idl     Automation enumerations and interfaces.  Includes DEGetBlockFmtNamesParam,
                DEGetBlockFmtNamesParam, and both Safe and Unsafe versions of the control.
                Two duplicate event interfaces were required for VB5 compatibility.

DHTMLEdit.cpp   Registry scripts and toolbox bitmaps.  One string ("DHTMLEd") unused.

DHTMLEdit.cpp   Implements safe and unsafe controls.  Unsafe control aggregates safe control
                and contains all unsafe code.  Sinks safe control events and fires them on
                unsafe control (required for VB5 compat.)
                Also implements IInternetSecurityManager for unsafe control when in edit mode,
                copied from VID's implementation.

DHTMLUIHNDL.cpp Implements IDocHostUIHandler, overriding GetHostInfo and ShowContextMenu.

DispExA.cpp     GetLength and GetElement for a JavaScript array.  Used by SetContextMenu
                when called from JS.

IAdvSink.cpp    Implements perfectly empty IAdviseSink for TriEdit site.

ICliSite.cpp    Implements IOleClientSite for TriEdit site, does nothing but GetContainer.

Idocsite.cpp    Implements IOleDocumentSite for TriEdit site, handles ActivateMe.

IIPsite.cpp     Implements IOleInPlaceSite for TriEdit site, minimal functionality.

Inc.cpp         Same as StdAfx.cpp in basic ATL control.  Compiles ATL cpp's.

IOleObj.cpp     For unsafe control, overrides GetUserClassID and GetUserType.

IPropSink.cpp   Implements minimal CImplPropertyNotifySink for TriEdit site.

PlgProt.cpp     Pluggable protocol handler for protocol "dhtmledN[N...]", adapted from VID.
                Allows us to override BaseURL, reload and optionally filter stream via
                URLOpenBlockingStream.  Parses security URL from outer most containing
                Trident instance.

ProxyFrame.cpp  Implements the bulk of the controls properties and methods.
                Creates and destroys hosted TriEdit aggregating Trident.  Handles ExecCommand.
                LoadDocument stashes string, URL or file name and loads via pluggable protocol.
                LATE_BIND_URLMON_WININET ifdefs allowed late loading of WinINet and UrlMon in 1.0.
                Switches between edit and browse mode.  Handles accelerators.  Finds default
                BaseURL. Calculates security URL for pluggable protocol.  Returns HTML stream to
                pluggable protocol.  Fires events from Trident on control.  Registers and
                unregisters pluggable protocol.

Site.cpp        Implements site for TriEdit.  Creates, destroys, initializes, loads and saves it.

TriFilter.cpp   Converts between stream, BSTR, file and URL.  Converts to and from Unicode.
                Provides single routine which interfaces with TriEdit's filtering.

Win95Wrp.cpp    Translates to ANSI API routines on win95/98, uses Unicode APIs on NT.

CPDHTMLEd.h     ATL event firing code for safe and unsafe control.

Private.h       A few interfaces used only internally.

TriEdSnk.cpp    Allows easy sinking of various Trident event interfaces.
