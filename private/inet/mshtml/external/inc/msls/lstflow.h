 *	The eight possible text flows are listed clockwise starting with default (Latin) one.

 *	lstflowES is the coordinate system used when line grows to East and text grows to South.
 *	(Next letter is to the right (east) of previous, next line is created below (south) the previous.) 
 *
 *	For lstflowES positive u moves to the right, positive v moves up. (V axis is always in the direction
 *	of ascender, opposite to text growing direction.
 *
 *	Notice it is not the way axes are pointing in the default Windows mapping mode MM_TEXT. 
 *	In MM_TEXT vertical (y) axis increase from top to bottom, 
 *	in lstflowES vertical (v) axis increase from bottom to top.
