;
; This file defines the base virtual address for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)
; The first token on a line is the name of the DLL and the second token is the
; base virtual address, in hexidecimal.  The third token is the maximum size of
; the DLL image file, including symbols.
;
;  NOTE:  I have used the convention of labelling unused areas as _FREExx_.
;  If you need an address,  these are available.
