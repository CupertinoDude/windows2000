------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Be sure the global environment variable _F3QADIR is set to your enlistment of the F3QA SLM project.

2.  Copy the file SRVANY.EXE to the WINNT35\SYSTEM drive.

3.  Add it as a service, with the following command:
      INSTSRV SMAILSVR C:\WINNT35\SYSTEM\SRVANY.EXE

4.  Using Services in the Control Panel, specify that the SMailSvr service starts automatically, uses the system account, and can interact with the desktop. (If you don't want to see a window or icon, leave this last option turned off)

5.  Begin REGEDT32, and add a 'Parameters' key under:
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SMailSvr

6.  Under this key, add the following 3 values:
      'Application' (type REG_SZ - Fully qualified Path Name)
       =D:\F3QA\TOOLS\X86\PERL.EXE
      'AppParameters' (type REG_SZ - Command Line Parameters)
       =D:\F3QA\BUILD\SMAILSVR.PL D:\MAILOUT
      'AppDirectory' (type REG_SZ - Starting Directory)
       =D:\MAILOUT

7.  Create the following 3 directories on your machine:
       D:\MAILOUT\SENT
       D:\MAILOUT\PENDING
       D:\MAILOUT\DEAD

8.  The frm3bld.mmf should be stored in the D:\MAILOUT directory

9.  Reboot the system to start the service if you selected automatic start, or use the follwoing commands to start and stop it manually:
      SC start SMailSvr
      SC stop SMailSvr
      
10.  If you selected "allow service to interact with desktop", you may wish to change the window properties so that it always remains small and out of your way.
