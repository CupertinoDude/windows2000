# Each line is one of:
#
# DENY [*=userlist] dst_addr dst_mask [op dst_port]
# DIRECT [*=userlist] dst_addr dst_mask [op dst_port]
# SOCKD [@=serverlist] [*=userlist] dst_addr dst_mask [op dst_port]
#
# Where userlist is a comma separated list of users (optional)
# dst_addr is a dotted quad IP address
# dst_mask is a dotted quad IP address
# op is one of EQ NEQ LT GT LE GE
# dst_port is the number or name of a destination port
# serverlist is a comma separated list of the name or IP address of 
# SOCKS V4 servers (use IP address for speed)
# 
# On connect each line is processed in order and the first line that matches
# is used. If no line matches the address is assumed to be Direct.
#
# Matching is done by taking the destination address and ANDing it with the
# dst_mask. The result is then compared to the dst_addr. If they match, then 
# if the userlist exists the current username is compared against this list.
# Also if the [op dst_port] exists, the destination port is compared to 
# dst_port and if the "op" is true, the line is used.
#
# DENY means to disallow the connect attemp.
# DIRECT means to attempt the connection as normal.
# SOCKD means to go the specified SOCKD server.
#
# If @=serverlist is not present the SOCKD server specified by the registry value:
# LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\HummingBird\SOCKS_SERVER is used.
