This directory contains the code for the 32-bit shim that implements
SOCKS V4 over the native Microsoft TCP stacks on Windows NT and Windows 95.
The code compiles on all NT RISC platforms.  WSOCK32.386 is the DEF file
for Intel platforms, while WSOCK32.AXP is the DEF file for all RISC platforms.
The RES.BIN resource is used by some Microsoft applications and is drawn
from the shipping Microsoft DLLs.
