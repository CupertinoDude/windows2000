/*
Current behavior for cookie importing:
on first entry:
	Check if netscape is default browser, identify version and save in registry.

on every entry:
	check if version is saved in registry, destructively merge
*/


/*
Something of a justification for behavior:
  There are a couple ways to determine the version of cookie file to be imported from.  For all
intents ane purposes, what is being determined is whether the version to import from is less than
or greater than/equal to four.
  The version of the the executeable associated with htm files is what we use.  If the executeable
associated with htm files is not netscape, then presumeably the user isn't using netscape and we
don't want the cookies anyhow.
  An alternative was to use the last installed version of netscape installed which is indicated
in the CurrentVersion\\AppPaths reg key.  This key gets ripped away though, if the user uninstalls
one version and uses an older version.  Also, we can't expect the user to be using the last
installed version of netscape.

  Once IE is installed and ran, it may be associated with htm files while we still want to import
cookies from the once active version of netscape.  Because of this the version of netscape found
to be used during DllInstall(true,HKLM is) saved in the registry.  This works on 
uninstallation/reinstallation since we can always expect DllInstall(true,HKLM) to be ran again
before reentry into any DllInstall(true,HKCU) where the cookies are imported for each user.
